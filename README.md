# Dictionary-App
🎯 Project Overview
A minimal and responsive Dictionary App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can search for a word, and the app will fetch and display the definition, phonetics, part of speech, and example sentences using a public API (like dictionaryapi.dev).

Perfect for beginners learning about APIs and DOM manipulation.
